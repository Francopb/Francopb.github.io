# Magneto-capillary systems (Inactive)

**Description:** This project investigates magneto-capillary systems composed of magnetic particles at the air-water interface. These systems combine magnetic and capillary interactions to produce rich and tunable behaviors. One line of research focuses on equilibrium systems, where the balance between magnetic repulsion and capillary attraction leads to the self-assembly of ordered, two-dimensional structures. Another line addresses out-of-equilibrium systems, in which time-varying magnetic fields drive particles into dynamic states that exhibit collective motion and emergent behaviors. These studies provide insights into fundamental self-organization principles and open avenues for designing active matter platforms.
