# Projects
## Active Projects

- [Collective (micro)robotics](./collective): This project studies multi-agent systems and how their interactions with the environment and each other lead to emergent collective behaviors for manipulation and assembly.


- [Soft robotics](./softrob): This project leverages nonlinear compliant mechanisms to embed physical intelligence in soft robots, focusing on mechanical interactions and system dynamics to enable coorfinated task execution.


## Past Projects

- [Magnetic micromanipulation](./magnetic): This project explores magnetic control of microrobots using torques and forces for precise manipulation, assembly, and navigation at the microscale.


- [Magneto-capillary systems](./magnetocap): This project studies magnetic particles at the air-water interface, exploring their self-assembly through magneto-capillary interactions and dynamic collective behaviors.


- [Thermocapillary manipulation](./thermocap): This project uses laser-induced thermocapillary flows to manipulate and assemble microscopic particles at the air-water interface, studying both control strategies and the underlying fluid dynamics.
