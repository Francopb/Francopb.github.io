Franco N. Piñan Basualdo received his M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Instituto Balseiro, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Argentina, in 2018.  He earned a joint Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences and Technology from Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, and in Automation from Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, France, in 2022.  As part of his doctoral training, he was a visiting researcher at the Physical Intelligence Department of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, in 2021. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the Surgical Robotics Lab at University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands from 2022 to 2024 He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Soft Robotics Group at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.  His research focuses on small-scale robotics, developing non-contact actuation methods, control strategies, and collective microrobotic systems that leverage both inter-agent and environmental interactions.
