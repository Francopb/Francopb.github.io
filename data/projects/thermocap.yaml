title: Thermocapillary manipulation
description: >
  This project uses laser-induced thermocapillary flows to manipulate and assemble microscopic particles at the air-water interface, studying both control strategies and the underlying fluid dynamics.
long_description: >
  This project explores the use of laser-induced thermocapillary flows for the manipulation and directed assembly of microscopic particles at the air-water interface.
  By locally heating the surface with focused laser beam controllable fluid flows emerge, enabling non-contact transport of floating objects.
  The research investigates both single- and multi-particle manipulation, including the coordinated actuation of multiple laser spots to achieve parallel control.
  In addition to manipulation strategies, the project also focuses on characterizing and understanding the generated flow fields to better exploit their dynamics for precise control and assembly.
