description: >
  This project explores magnetic control of microrobots using torques and forces for precise manipulation, assembly, and navigation at the microscale.
long_description: >
  This project investigates the use of magnetic fields to steer and control microrobotic agents at the microscale.
  It covers both open-loop systems, where magnetic effects are used to influence system properties, and closed-loop systems, where real-time feedback enables stable actuation and manipulation.
  The approach exploits both magnetic torques, generated by uniform magnetic fields to induce rotation, and magnetic forces, produced by field gradients to enable translational motion and levitation.
  These mechanisms are applied to tasks such as micromanipulation, assembly, and navigation in complex environments.
