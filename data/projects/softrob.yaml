long_description: >
  This project explores the use of nonlinear compliant mechanisms, such as inflatables, to embed physical intelligence into soft robotic systems.
  By harnessing the intrinsic mechanical properties of these elements, the research aims to reduce the need for complex control.
  The work focuses on two main directions: first, studying and leveraging the interactions between nonlinear elements to achieve sequencing and computation;
  and second, exploiting the system's dynamics to enable coordinated task execution with minimal external inputs.
  This approach supports the development of autonomous, adaptable, and efficient soft robotic platforms.
