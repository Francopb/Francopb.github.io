title: Collective (micro)robotics
description: >
  This project studies multi-agent systems and how their interactions with the environment and each other lead to emergent collective behaviors for manipulation and assembly.
long_description: >
  This project investigates systems composed of multiple agents and how their interactions give rise to collective behaviors.
  We explore mechanisms of coordination and control within these systems, aiming to understand and engineer emergent properties that cannot be achieved by individual agents.
  These emergent behaviors are exploited for advanced manipulation and the assembly of structures. In addition to inter-agent dynamics, the project also studies how collective systems interact with their surrounding environment, including fluidic, magnetic, and surface-mediated influences.
